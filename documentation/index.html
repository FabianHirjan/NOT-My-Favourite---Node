    <h1>IEEE Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document provides the software requirements specification (SRS) for the NoF web application. It outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, user interactions, and system behaviors.</p>

    <h2>2. Overall Description</h2>
    <p>The NoF web application is designed to manage various classes of objects and abstract/digital artifacts. Users interact with the application to provide feedback, view inventories and statistics, and access essential functionalities through a REST/GraphQL Web API.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
    <p>The NoF web application interacts with users and backend systems to manage data related to entities such as products, services, and user interactions.</p>

    <h3>2.2 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
    <p>The application is intended for users who wish to browse, search, and interact with different types of objects and artifacts. Users may have varying levels of technical expertise.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Operating Environment</h3>
    <p>The application runs in a web browser environment and communicates with backend servers to fetch and update data.</p>

    <h2>3. Functional Requirements</h2>

        <div class="requirement-heading">4.2 Performance</div>
        <div class="requirement-description">
            <p>The system shall respond to user interactions within 2 seconds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="requirement-notes">
            <p>Note: Performance testing shall be conducted under various load conditions to verify responsiveness.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Include more non-functional requirements as needed -->

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This IEEE Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive overview of the NoF web application's requirements, including functional and non-functional aspects. It serves as a guideline for the development and testing of the application.</p>
